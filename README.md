Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

Steps:
- Used the URL of the 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' JSON from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to pull in the data for the visualization. 

- Imported and visualize the data by doing the following:
     - Used Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset using their longitude and latitude.
     - Created data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by size 
     - Used data markers to reflect the depth of the earthquake by color

- Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when marker is clicked

- Created a legend that will provide context for map data specofic to earthquake depth
